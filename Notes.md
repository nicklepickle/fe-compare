# Notes

## Key Differences

- Svelte and Vue use HTML-first templating while JSX (React and Solid) is a JavaScript-first templating language.
- Vue and React use a virtual DOM while Svelte and Solid do not use a virtual DOM.
- HTMX relies on server side templating (in this case with express hbs) and is *mostly* a pure HTML solution.
- ES6 uses no templating or framework and is a pure javascript solution provided as a baseline.
