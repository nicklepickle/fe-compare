# Front End Javascipt Library Comparison

## Goal
Implement a small project which demostrates basic setup and usage. Project will include some non-trivial 
requirements including communitaction across components, validation, multiple coalescing API calls. 

## Evaluate on
- Market Share (use of library, developer availability, age of project)
- Performance (page load, memory usage, dynamic request speed/size)
- Portability (deviation from web standards, non-portable concepts/syntax)
- Maintainability (lines of code, release stability, number of dependencies, documentation)

## Potential candidates
- React
- HTMX
- Svelte
- Vue
- ES6
